description: Finally got around to setting up this blog

![init()](./init/init.png)
I finally got around to setting up this blog. I plan to write mostly short-form posts about my learnings on Swift and other iOS and mobile topics, as well as my journey towards becoming an indie developer.

## My Background

I'm an Engineering Manager with over a decade and a half of iOS development experience. I can still remember writing apps for iPhone OS 3.0 when we finally got copy and paste support. Seems crazy to think core functionality like that wasn't available in earlier versions.

## What I'm Up To

When I'm not working as an EM, I'm usually balancing life between finding time to work on indie side-projects (or starting another one) and spending time with my young family. 

I'm also a big fan of AI and think we're just at the tip of a very big iceberg. I'm always exploring new ways to make myself more efficient so I can actually finish one of my side-projects!

## Outside of Tech

On a personal level (not that you probably care), I live in the UK and love being outdoors in the countryside when it's not rainingâ€”which does happen occasionally. I have a marine aquarium that's another obsession of mine, and of course I'm building an OO gauge model railway. 

## Finally!

I can stand proud and proclaim that this blog is now live, so at least I can tick this off my endless list of things to finish.
